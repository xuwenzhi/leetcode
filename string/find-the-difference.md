# find-the-difference

[https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

```
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

# solution

分别统计两个字符串的数量，然后再比较即可。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int counter[26] = {0};
        int countert[26] = {0};
        for (auto i : s) {
            counter[i-'a']++;
        }
        
        for (auto i : t) {
            countert[i-'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i=0;i<26;i++) {
            if (counter[i] != countert[i]) {
                return i+'a';
            }
        }
        
        return ' ';
    }
};
